v0.011: 
	- Small refactor of Base AI and derived classes: Dominion Defender, Pirate Raider 
	and Scourgling all should work now.
	- Local Ships Manager now handles team aggro. NPCs on the same team should dogpile you if
	you upset them.
	- Flee State added, given to Courier and Freighter NPCs
	- Bullet pools now despawn when ships destroyed or systems change
	- Bullet pools no longer tagged as actual ships.
	- Scourge now spawn with their own visitor list.
	- Scourge (and in theory, pirates) now aggro on system entry.
	- Pirates now prioritize the nearest target on their enemy list.
	- Hyperspace visual effect added. Needs tweaking and limiting player rotation, but it's pretty.
	- Luna graphic added.
