# MERCURIAL

#### v.0.00 6

Mercurial is a topdown space adventure with roleplaying elements. The goal is to
recreate the classic Mac game _[Escape Velocity]_ (http://www.ambrosiasw.com) with modern gameplay that reflects the last 15 years since EV:Nova, a more indepth campaign and stronger pilot characterization.

The player character of Mercurial has just been granted their basic Starpilot's
License and suddenly the galaxy has opened to them. They can serve as agents of 
the Terran Dominion, investigate the mysteries of humanity's predecessors, trade
goods from planet to planet or explore the cosmos. 

## CURRENT STATUS:
Game is not really playable or fun yet. Things to do before it works:

1. AI should change state based on conditional checks -- have I been shot? Did a pirate just enter the system? Is an enemy faction member here?

2. More weapons, and the ability to buy/sell them on a planet

3. Saving/loading player data
