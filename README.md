# MERCURIAL

#### v.0.007

Mercurial is a topdown space adventure with roleplaying elements. The goal is to
recreate the classic Mac game _[Escape Velocity]_ (http://www.ambrosiasw.com) with modern gameplay that reflects the last 15 years since EV:Nova, a more indepth campaign and stronger pilot characterization.

The player character of Mercurial has just been granted their basic Starpilot's
License and suddenly the galaxy has opened to them. They can serve as agents of 
the Terran Dominion, investigate the mysteries of humanity's predecessors, trade
goods from planet to planet or explore the cosmos. 

## CURRENT STATUS:
Game is approaching playable, but is not really fun yet. Things to do before it really starts to work well.

1. Add pirate enemies.

2. Things to do on a planet. 

3. Customizing player ship load out and saving settings in an intelligent way. 

4. Saving/loading player data from session to session.
