# MERCURIAL

#### v.0.004

Mercurial is a topdown space adventure with roleplaying elements. The goal is to
recreate the classic Mac game _[Escape Velocity]_ (http://www.ambrosiasw.com) with modern gameplay that reflects the last 15 years since EV:Nova, a more indepth campaign and stronger pilot characterization.

The player character of Mercurial has just been granted their basic Starpilot's
License and suddenly the galaxy has opened to them. They can serve as agents of 
the Terran Dominion, investigate the mysteries of humanity's predecessors, trade
goods from planet to planet or explore the cosmos. 

## COMPLETED TASKS
1. Implemented basic flight: both inertialess and physics based
2. Implemented structure for systems/planets reading from json files
3. Added scrolling space backdrop and placeholder assets
4. Placeholder playerData, pilotData, and other structures that need to be built 
5. Barebones asteroid behaviour added
6. Placeholder planet menu and behaviour
7. Skeleton of weapons/defenses addons added
8. Placeholder audio! 
9. Some simple lighting fx added. More to come!

## GOALS FOR NEXT (REAL) BUILD
1. Basic NPC ships with simple movement.
2. Simple laser weapon for ships -- DONE!
3. Health and shields systems for ships

## GOALS FOR LATER
1. Jumping btwn star systems
2. Flesh out landing on planets
3. Planet Menu should display data from planet, including sub windows
4. Star map menu
5. Player stats screen -- Started, need to integrate but the beginnings of the scene are in the MenuScenes folder

## Current Tasks:
1. Finish implementation of menu systems, filling them with proper data from json
2. Implement Ship #ID system -- this will be used for centralizing audio sources, spawning, 
communications, etc.
