# MERCURIAL

#### v.0.00 5

Mercurial is a topdown space adventure with roleplaying elements. The goal is to
recreate the classic Mac game _[Escape Velocity]_ (http://www.ambrosiasw.com) with modern gameplay that reflects the last 15 years since EV:Nova, a more indepth campaign and stronger pilot characterization.

The player character of Mercurial has just been granted their basic Starpilot's
License and suddenly the galaxy has opened to them. They can serve as agents of 
the Terran Dominion, investigate the mysteries of humanity's predecessors, trade
goods from planet to planet or explore the cosmos. 

## CURRENT STATUS:
To get the game into a playable tech demo state, the following needs to be implemented:
1. Simple follow and shoot AI for enemy ships -- COMPLETE, but only for inertialess ships
2. Things to do when you land on planets
3. Jumping systems needs to load the appropriate ships into the current scene.

...once these are in place, the game will actually be a /game/, hopefully.
